# Vet Clinic Database

> This is a project from the first week of the fourth module of the Microverse Program.

As its name suggests, Vet Clinic Database contains a list of SQL commands to create a table in a database and insert animals with their respective information. Just like if the animals were patients in a vet clinic, and the information about them is stored in a table in a database.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
